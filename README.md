# Address Cleaning Using Python Libraries

This project demonstrates the usage of various Python libraries for cleaning address data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to clean address data stored in a Pandas DataFrame using different methods provided by libraries like `fuzzywuzzy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `re`.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Pandas (`pandas`)
- FuzzyWuzzy (`fuzzywuzzy`)
- Warnings (`warnings`)
- Regular Expression (`re`)
- TQDM (`tqdm`)
- Datetime (`datetime`)
- Collections (`collections`)
- Concurrent Futures (`concurrent.futures`)
- Abstract Syntax Trees (`ast`)
- IPython (`IPython`)

## Features Implemented

1. Address data cleaning using fuzzy matching and string similarity.
2. Utilizing regular expressions for pattern matching in addresses.
3. Cleaning addresses with missing or incorrect data.
4. Handling warnings during address processing.
5. Employing multi-threading for efficient cleaning of large datasets.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage

The primary script `address_cleaner.py` contains the main logic for address cleaning. Modify the script as necessary and execute it to clean your address data.

```python
# Example usage of address_cleaner.py
